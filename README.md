## Dominic System

_"...The Dominic System uses an easy-to-remember number-to-letter conversion and the initials of memorable people, as well as journeys that are like memory palaces..."_

When creating my own mnemonic for the dominic system I largely based in on the Ron Hale-Evans' template [mnemonics_public.txt](dominic-system/mnemonics_public.txt), finding suitable replacements which focus on my interests of music and art.

My compiled list is at: [dominic-template](dominic-system/dominic_template.md)

I made a list pertinent to me including plenty of visual artists and musicians and includes famous people who I find amusing.

For a few initials I had some real difficulty finding people I knew, so I added those with memorable humorous names. For instance:  05 = OE = [Oscar Egg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10185512) a Olympic cyclist.
