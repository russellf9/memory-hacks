## Dominic System

_"...The Dominic System uses an easy-to-remember number-to-letter conversion and the initials of memorable people, as well as journeys that are like memory palaces..."_

When creating my own mnemonic for the dominic system I largely based in on the Ron Hale-Evans' template [mnemonics_public.txt](dominic-system/mnemonics_public.txt), finding suitable replacements which focus on my interests of music and art.

My compiled list is at: [dominic-template.txt](dominic-system/dominic-template.txt)
