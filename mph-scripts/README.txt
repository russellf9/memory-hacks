About these scripts
-------------------

The two scripts in this archive are 'dominate' and 'pyro'.

### dominate ###

The dominate script helps you remember long lists of things with the
Dominic System (or with Tony Buzan's SEM^3 system, if you supply the
right data). It appears in Hack #8, "Dominate Your Memory".

Usage example:

$ perl dominate dominic.dat 8071 8100

### pyro ###

The pyro script is so named because it is the indirect descendant of a
HyperCard stack called Inspirograph, and because while I was writing
it, I was reminded of the Creative Fire of the Stoics, and also
because it allows "expyration" (breathing out every possible
permutation of the data in a file) as well as "inspyration" (breathing
in a few permutations and allowing them to inspire you). It occurs in
Hack #20, "Force Your Connections" and Hack #49, "Roll the Dice".

Usage examples:

$ perl pyro utopia.dat place

$ perl pyro utopia.dat place all

$ perl pyro whattodo.dat activity

$ perl pyro whattodo.dat funhome

$ perl pyro whattodo.dat funout

Read _Mind Performance Hacks_ by Ron Hale-Evans, O'Reilly Media,
February 2006, ISBN 0-596-10153-8, of course!

I hope you have anywhere near as much fun with these scripts as I
do. Plus, they're free as in freedom, so hack away, and if you improve
them, please let me know.
